# [aws_lambda_events](./aws_lambda_events)

This crate provides strongly-typed [AWS Lambda event structs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html) event structs in Rust.

The [`aws_lambda_events`](./aws_lambda_events) crate is where all logic lives and the [`aws_lambda_events_codegen`](./aws_lambda_events_codegen) crate generates portions of it from event definitions.
